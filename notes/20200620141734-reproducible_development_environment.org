* RDE
In the future it won't make much sense to do video like that:
https://youtu.be/DX_gQTQLUZc Person will be able to replicate such setup with
just few lines of config file.
** Perks

:END:
- Fear free environment :: rde control all the data, which have to be
  synced/backed up, everything else is reproducible from this data.
- Truly reproducible :: When you can fix project, that was released 10 years ago
- Instant set-up :: When developer don't have to spend hours to get all
  necessary libs and packages installed and configured in his system.
- Close to prod :: When you have same binaries on production.
- Dev/system env separation :: System can be updated, without breaking project
  environment.
- Simple :: Complex setup without complex setup process. In more details that
  idea described in [[file:20200804113904-rde_pitch.org][RDE pitch]].

** Nice bonuses
- Collaborate on env :: Developers can develop their development environment

** Difference with puppet/chef/ansible
- [[https://github.com/kalbasit/shabka/blob/master/doc/congruent.md][Declarative congruence]] is a system management method, which simplify the work
  with infrastructure.
* Funny idea
- rde.sh from [[file:20200717164909-cool_domain_names.org][Cool Domain Names]] can be a Reasonable Defaults, rather than RDE
