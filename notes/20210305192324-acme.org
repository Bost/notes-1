#+title: Acme

The text editor, integrating development environment, ui
platform. It's not extensible in the sense of [[id:e6ea3c52-b620-40e7-84ff-e0628afd5557][Emacs]], doesn't have
themes, configurations, but it integrates with tools from the
environment, which makes it very powerful.

Every piece of text can be executed as a command. To extend menu bar
you can just write the name of the command in it.

The state of acme instance (windows/panes, content of buffer and so
on) is exposed via FUSE as a bunch of directories and files.
