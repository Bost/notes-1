The text editor, integrating development environment, ui
platform. It's not extensible in the sense of [[file:20200816095244-emacs.org][Emacs]], doesn't have
themes, configurations, but it integrates with tools from the
environment, which makes it very powerful.

Every piece of text can be executed as a command. To extend menu bar
you can just write the name of the command in it.

The state of acme instance (windows/panes, content of buffer and so
on) is exposed via FUSE as a bunch of directories and files.
