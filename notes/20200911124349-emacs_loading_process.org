#+title: Emacs Loading Process

[[info:elisp#Startup Summary][Startup Summary]] covers most of the necessary information on startup process.

Interesting notes:
- There are ~before-init-time~ and ~after-init-time~, which can be
  used later for measuring startup perfomance by calling
  ~emacs-init-time~.
- autoloads creates a placeholder, which loads actual function on
  first call.
- [[file:20200911211835-use_package.org][use-package]] has a lot of mechanisms to make package load as lazy as
  possible.
- Startup with plugged charger 2x faster

Since version 27 use [[file:20200911125123-xdg_base_directory_specification.org][XDG Base Directory Specification]], scans (at least) for:
- ~~/.emacs~
- ~~/.emacs.el~
- ~~/.emacs.d/init.el~
- ~~/.config/emacs/init.el~

Evaluate first encountered file, others are ignored. Not sure about
order in the list, but ~~/.config/emacs/init.el~ checked last.
