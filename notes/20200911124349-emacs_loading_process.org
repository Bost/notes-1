#+title: Emacs Loading Process
- related :: [[id:e6ea3c52-b620-40e7-84ff-e0628afd5557][Emacs]]
  
[[info:elisp#Startup Summary][Startup Summary]] covers most of the necessary information on startup process.

Interesting notes:
- There are ~before-init-time~ and ~after-init-time~, which can be
  used later for measuring startup perfomance by calling
  ~emacs-init-time~.
- autoloads creates a placeholder, which loads actual function on
  first call.
- [[id:0bd75f7e-a110-4803-b22c-83b5476ed1ef][use-package]] has a lot of mechanisms to make package load as lazy as
  possible.
- Startup with plugged charger 2x faster

Since version 27 use [[id:5d5ef851-d688-4857-9d2e-e5c575e8fc1c][XDG Base Directory Specification]], scans (at least) for:
- ~~/.emacs~
- ~~/.emacs.el~
- ~~/.emacs.d/init.el~
- ~~/.config/emacs/init.el~

Evaluate first encountered file, others are ignored. Not sure about
order in the list, but ~~/.config/emacs/init.el~ checked last.
