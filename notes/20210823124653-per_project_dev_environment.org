#+title: Per-Project Dev Environment
#+filetags: Stream

* Introduction
The goal is to get all necessary stuff set and ready to use for each
project without interfering with other projects and the operating system.

The environment should be easy to share and must be the same for
different people/deploys/hosts.

* The Twelve-Factor App
https://12factor.net/

A set of practices for developing SaaS.

- Minimize new engineer introduction cost.
- Improve portability between OSes.
- Simplify the deployement.
- Minimize divergence between development and production.
- Scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or
  development practice.
* Environment Parts
- Dependencies (libraries, external apps)
- Tools (compiler, linter, clients, etc)
- Environment Variables
* Dependencies and Tools
Never rely on implicit existence of system-wide packages.

Only a dependency manager is a prerequisites.
* Configs (Environment Variables)
Strict separation of config from code. Config varies substantially
across deploys, code does not.

- Credentials.
- App settings.
- Other services locators.
* Backing Services
Queue/Database/API.

Not covering this stuff today.
* Environment Gap
- Time :: between implementation and delivery.
- Personnel :: various roles have different tools and backgrounds.
- Tools :: libraries can differ between hosts/deploys.

It affects not only developers and admins, but also users.
* Demo
** Tools
- [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]]
- [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-environment.html][guix environment]]
- gpg
** Demo Project
- secrets
- pytorch
- reproducibility
- leiningen
* Problems
- ~M-x man~
- ~M-x info~
- Higher startup time
* Summary
- Can work on several projects effortlessly.
- Can share the dev environment precisely.
- Can deliver software faster.
