#+title: Better than virtualenv
#+filetags: Stream

* What we will do today
We will create a reproducible development environment for python project with native dependencies.
* What is a development environment
- dependencies
- shell
- tools (vcs, *make/build, deps management, cluster management)
- Editor or IDE
* Why?
** History of single C project
** Long instructions
** Virtualenv
Doesn't provide:
- Native dependencies
- [[id:60ff9de8-1a31-4128-9767-e901aba3ce1f][Reproducibility]]
- Shared dependencies
* Use cases
** Few projects with different deps
** Easy setup without instructions
** Shared environment for the team
** Caching of long builds

* Practice
** nix-shell
- PATH
- env vars
** direnv
** lorri
** flakes
- env without project
- dataset
** Deploy to prod
* Question
* Next episode
python telegram bot with deploy to aws
* Summary
As simple as
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Install nix package manager w/ flakes
nix develop github:abcdw/rde
#+END_SRC
