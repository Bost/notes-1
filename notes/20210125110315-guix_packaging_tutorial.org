* Guix environment

- obs-wlrobs
- obs-spectralizer
- obs-next
* Package structure
** Source
** Different inputs
- native-inputs :: Required for building but not runtime â€“ installing
  a package through a substitute won't install these inputs.
- inputs :: Installed in the store but not in the profile, as well as
  being present at build time.
- propagated-inputs :: Installed in the store and in the profile, as
  well as being present at build time.
** Build systems
* Setting load-path
* Getting guix
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git
