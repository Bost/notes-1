#+title: The Rise of Worse is Better

- related :: [[id:bfb6da98-b6fc-440f-9447-979af5fcfb97][To revisit]]

The article is about two approaches for design and implememntation:
MIT/Stanford and New Jersey.

While New Jersey's approach produces less correct/quality/right
result, but this result is more viral and widely-accepted, that means
it gains more popularity and adoption, later it will be improved and
be almost 90% as good as a right and correct product.

The lesson to learn: in most cases it better to do a 50% right thing,
let it spread and improve to 90% later, rather then trying to
implement 100% right thing at the beginning.
