Similiar idea with [[file:20200731150359-nixos_tmpfs_as_root.org][NixOS: tmpfs as root]], but using brtfs and snapshot
capabilities, which helps to clear root on every boot.

Uses [[file:20200810183326-dm_crypt.org][dm-crypt]] for creating entcrypted volumes and [[file:20200810182845-brtfs.org][Brtfs]] subvolume features to
create multiple mount points.

Additionally discusses questions about [[file:20200810182347-docker.org][Docker]] and [[file:20200810182522-lxd.org][LXD]].
