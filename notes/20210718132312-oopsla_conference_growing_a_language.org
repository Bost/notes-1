#+title: OOPSLA Conference: Growing a Language

[[id:4d754bb3-3afc-4c14-bbcc-3aad16790a96][Building a Language]] start from a small language or make it big from
the beginning?  When we start with a small language we can't say much
at the start, we must first define more words, then we can speak what
is in our mind.

* Important thoughts
- Instead of designing a thing, design a way of doing.
- To make language sucessful, start small and make users grow with a
  language.
- Short words works well if we choose them well.
* Spoiler
During the talk the author uses only words with one syllable, until he
defines the word.
* Definitions
Some of definitions, mentioned in the talk.
- Vocabulary :: set of words.
- Language :: vocab + set of rules what string of words might mean.
- To Define :: tell what a word means and add it to your vocab and vocab
  of each person who hears you.
- To Program :: make up a list of things to do and choices to make to be
  done by computer.
- Program :: such a list.
- Example :: is a thing of a set of things I put in front of you, to
  show that some property shared between all things in the set.
- Primitive :: something we can take as granted.
