#+title: The SCARF model

Model describes the way people socially interact. It has 5 domains,
each of them contributes to threat or reward component.
- Status
- Certainty
- Autonomy
- Relatedness
- Fairness

For example there is a task, which won't make your social status
higher (nobody will know that you did it for example), you don't know
how to do it, you are very restricted with the tools, have to do it in
non-friendly environment and won't get any cookies for that. It's very
unlikely to be done, because all of those aspects are threating and
not rewarding. Chances increases if you get ability to pick proper
tool, get the respect for completion and so on.
