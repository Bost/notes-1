#+title: The Modern Emacs

* Introduction
We cover the needs of power users and porfessionals, who spent a lot
of time editing text
* Ideas
There is no easy way, we have to learn and practice things to become
efficient and productive with it.  It's especially true for any
non-trivial tools.

Important properties:
- Explorability
- Extensibility
- Reliability
- Perfomance

* My Way
*Most important check points.*
- vim :: ~10y, modal editing, partially extensible and explorable.
- Spacemacs :: ~3y, works out of the box, but with performance,
  conistence and explorability penalty.
- custom config :: ~1y, good learning experience, reasonable perf.
- doom emacs :: <1y, good OOTB and performance, small inconsistencies
  and conflicts with built-in functionality, lack of integration with
  OS/PM.
- vanilla emacs :: <1y, poor OOTB, great learning experience,
  extensible, explorable, performant.
- rde emacs :: sane OOTB, reliable, performant, well-os-integrated,
  extensible and almost explorable, plays well with built-ins.

*The approach shift*.
Give me more -> Give me less.
* Building Working Environment approach
- Reproducible
- Minimalistic
- Consistent
- Offline-friendly
* Hotkeys and Modal Editing
** Vanilla
- Double tap
* Color Scheme
* Explorability
- ~find-library~
- ~C-h f~
- ~C-h v~
- ~C-h r i~
* Completion

* Future Steps
- Native Compilation
