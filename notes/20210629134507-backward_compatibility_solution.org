#+title: Backward Compatibility Solution

It's possible to make the code to has an expiration date, it will make
it unecessary to mark something as deprecated, just not re-sign/update
expiration date.  It will be possible to make deprecation process much
more natural and will allow not to keep legacy code for centuries.

Similar mechanism is used for [[id:52b0eb9a-598c-4732-846f-654932eda0fd][gpg]] keys.
