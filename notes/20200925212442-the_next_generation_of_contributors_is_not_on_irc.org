Talk-recommended defaults for building new community:
| sync        | -                          |
| async       | [[id:79b7fa60-81c9-42e9-ad13-7d62f24301e0][Discource]]                  |
| Face 2 Face | Zoom                       |
| News        | twitter & mail newsletters |

Agree with [[id:79b7fa60-81c9-42e9-ad13-7d62f24301e0][Discource]], but prefer [[id:8fe942a4-15b8-4d15-8157-f426f5f7f928][Jitsi]] for videoconferencing. Mail
newsletters is also good, I'm curious how good mailing lists are?
There are federated and ethical alternatives to twitter, but they have
less number of users.
