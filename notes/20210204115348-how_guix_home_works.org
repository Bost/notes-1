* What and Why?
- User packages
- Dotfiles
- User-wide configurations
- User services
* home-environment record
* Services
* Differences of guix-home-manager
- Read only home and /data
- New notion of extension-point
- Lack of important services
- Other cool, but arguable design descisions
* Future features
- onlogin script
- shepherd service
- activation script
- gpg-agent/pass/mpv/emacs/mbsync/etc
- operating-system integration instead of skeletons
* Future steps
- Write contribution guide
- Write documentation
- Propose it to upstream
- Move rde/* to home environment
