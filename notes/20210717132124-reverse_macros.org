#+title: Reverse Macros
#+filetags: Idea

Instead of using macros, which are hard to debug, it maybe better to
use snippets + special representation/display of some parts of the
code.  When (reverse-macro-mode) enabled you work concise and sugary
code, when it disabled you work on "macro expanded" code.
