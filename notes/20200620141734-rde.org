#+title: rde

Is a project helping to create [[file:20200620141734-reproducible_development_environment.org][Reproducible Development Environment]]s.

* Notes/Thoughts
- There is a desire to make a special subsystem like flakes, which
  allows to reference files, whithout using local-file.
- The same thing for directories and states, it would be cool to
  obtain target directory of the state to sate path's in configs of
  related program. (feature-password-store could accept state item
  instead of paths/urls).
