Is a project helping to create [[id:7845ce2e-e349-405a-85bb-44a983ed4860][Reproducible Development Environment]]s.

* Notes/Thoughts
- There is a desire to make a special subsystem like flakes, which
  allows to reference files, whithout using local-file.
- The same thing for directories and states, it would be cool to
  obtain target directory of the state to sate path's in configs of
  related program. (feature-password-store could accept state item
  instead of paths/urls).
