Imaging you sending a link to line in the file in the project to your
colleague: ~file:///home/bob/work/guix/file.scm:34~, but he keep this
project in the other directory, for example ~~/projects/guix~.

~{:project :guix}/files.scm:34~ could be the way to go. It doesn't
have to be a text, it can be a structured object.

Can it introduce new vulnerabilities?
