#+title: The PGP Problem

Article describing problems of [[file:20200907140005-openpgp.org][OpenPGP]] and [[file:20200907134309-gnupg.org][GnuPG]]. 30 years is a lot of time for
cryptography, it's hard to keep backward compatibility in such old software and
introduce modern approaches. Web of trust is a nice idea, but works not as good
as it sounds. [[file:20200907134309-gnupg.org][gpg]] has some purely written code and vulnurabilities appears from
time to time. UX is bad, even technically advanced people have a lot of problems
with the tool.
