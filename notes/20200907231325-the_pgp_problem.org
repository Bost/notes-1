#+title: The PGP Problem

Article describing problems of [[id:9353387c-bc3c-4c2f-8882-7ae5500bb9ca][OpenPGP]] and [[id:52b0eb9a-598c-4732-846f-654932eda0fd][GnuPG]]. 30 years is a lot of time for
cryptography, it's hard to keep backward compatibility in such old software and
introduce modern approaches. Web of trust is a nice idea, but works not as good
as it sounds. [[id:52b0eb9a-598c-4732-846f-654932eda0fd][gpg]] has some purely written code and vulnurabilities appears from
time to time. UX is bad, even technically advanced people have a lot of problems
with the tool.
