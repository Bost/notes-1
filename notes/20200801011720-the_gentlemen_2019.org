Nice and very british movie, comedy. Filming and storytelling is unusual and
very skilled. Atmosphere is awesome: pubs, sport costumes, interior. Charismatic
right-hand man of the boss. Coach and his pupil are minor heroes, but they are
cool and funny and add a lot of charm. Despite the fact that so many people were
killed during the action, the overall feeling from movie is warm, cozy. There
are no obvious bad guy, everyone has some own aesthetic style. I can't sum up
the moral of this work, but it was a pleasure to watch such well-filmed and
atmospheric movie.
