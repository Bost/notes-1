#+title: Utility vs Usability

Short article about Drew DeVault's approach for creating tools for
programmers.

Contains nice picture/table, which shows how much time you spend
during five years doing repitative tasks with different frequency.

The very interesting idea that we have to promote mentorship and not
to sell utility in favour of usability, especially for professional
tools. There are some cases, when usability matters, but in most cases
utility is more important for such tools.
