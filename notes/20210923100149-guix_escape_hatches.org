#+title: Guix Escape Hatches
#+filetags: :Stream:

* Introduction
SCHEDULED: <2021-10-05 Tue>
What to do if you think that there are not enough packages in GNU Guix? 
How to install and use software, which is not available in Guix repo.

* Is the Number of Packages Really That Small?
https://repology.org/

Who does better?

* Why it is not in Guix Repo?
- Licensing :: weak condition.
- Boostrapping :: strong technical condition.
- Guix is Young :: founded in 2012. [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Linux_Distribution_Timeline_Dec._2020.svg][Linux Distro Timeline]].

Sometimes understanding the background, technical details and
adjusting the expectations can solve the problem.

* How to Handle it?
- Use packaged software.
- Use apropriate hardware.
- Additional [[http://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/en/guix.html#Channels][channels]] and substitutes.
- Package it.
- [[http://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/en/guix.html#index-nix_002dservice_002dtype][Nix]] package manager.
- Docker.
  
* Practice

Add a nix-service-type.

#+begin_src shell
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
nix-channel --update
source /run/current-system/profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
nix-shell -p nixUnstable
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' shell nixpkgs#hello
#+end_src

** TODO Add experimental features to config
https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Non-NixOS
* Conclusion
- Guix is already quite good.
- There are escape hatches.
- You can make Guix even better.
