#+title: The Law of Leaky Abstractions

Abstractions leaks and there are many examples:

- IP can't guarantee packages delivery, TCP over IP even more so.
- You have to know underlying mechanisms to make declarative SQL
  queries work efficently enough.
- ~"foo" + "bar"~ in C++.

In most cases sooner or later the abstraction will leak and will drag
you down (up to the bare metal and physics in worst case). Thus
underlying levels must be simple and clean. If you abstract away some
dirty hacks, they will hit you or someone, who use those abstractions
very hard and will force you or someone to make much obscure
abstractions to "fix" them, which will also leak and hit even harder.

[[file:20210219204651-building_an_operating_system.org][Building an operating system]] is an important part of making underlying
levels simple and clean. It should reduce the impact of leaking
abstractions. Currently, poorly designed OSes hits us on every level of
software development.
