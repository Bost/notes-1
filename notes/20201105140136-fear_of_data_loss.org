#+title: Fear of Data Loss

In modern world you rarely know if the data is backed up/synced, is
this folder is still necessary to exist or you can remove it.

This fear can be overcomed with [[file:20200620141734-reproducible_development_environment.org][RDE]]:
- your OS and tools are reproducible
- your data is separate from OS and under control of [[file:20201105140606-rde_cli.org][rde cli]] (you know
  when it's synced/backed up)
