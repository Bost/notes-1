#+title: Fear of Data Loss

In modern world you rarely know if the data is backed up/synced, is
this folder is still necessary to exist or you can remove it.

This fear can be overcomed with [[id:7845ce2e-e349-405a-85bb-44a983ed4860][RDE]]:
- your OS and tools are reproducible
- your data is separate from OS and under control of [[id:70fc1da0-53e3-454c-afb5-47daaf748769][rde cli]] (you know
  when it's synced/backed up)
