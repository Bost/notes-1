* Comparison
** Communication and Review
- Full-fledged dev tools vs Web-based text editor for
  review. (Intermediate forge-dependent semi-IDE, which can be changed
  anytime?)
- Custom patch format vs Configurable commit deltas representation.
- Complete [[notmuch-tree:thread:{tag:example}][thread]] vs Diverse issues/PRs/inline review comments.
- Specialized threaded discussions vs Linear mixed list of comments.
- Persistent durable discussion vs ephemeral commits and comments.
- Possibility to interject and provide changes.
- Easy to pick up and carry on a stale [[notmuch-tree:id:20210703165127.12316-1-brice@waegenei.re][changeset]].
- Private discussion inside [[notmuch:id:87lf7x5lb5.fsf@gnu.org][subthread]].
** CI/Testing
** Offline work
- Forum with all discussions and changes
- Full-text search
* Sample emails
- [[notmuch-tree:thread:{tag:example}][Examples]] :: list of examples
- [[notmuch-tree:id:20210613101538.10668-1-ludo@gnu.org][[bug#48696] [PATCH v2 0/4] Documenting...]] :: proper threading for v2
* Problems of ML and Possible Solutions
** Flexibility
- Posibility to screw up the subject.
- Reply to wrong subthread and/or recipients.
- Inline and inline/attachment patches.
** CI for patches in the thread
Is this a real issue?
- https://sourcehut.org/blog/2020-07-14-setting-up-ci-for-mailing-lists/
** Unfamiliarity
- Well-defined contribution guidlines
- [[file:~/work/rde/rde/examples/abcdw/configs.scm::(feature-mail-settings][rde]]
** Spam
** Comprehensive list of issues
- Part of the git
- Part of the forge
** Joining to ML later
- [[https://public-inbox.org/README.html][public-inbox]]
** Social-prove
- Mirror on github?
* Small Demo
[[notmuch-tree:id:87y2akhiz1.fsf@trop.in][Email to guix-patches@gnu.org: [PATCH 0/4] Essential home services]]
* Conclusion
- The problems exist, but they are not blockers.
- ML provides integrated experience.
- Privacy and attention friendly.
- Reliability and federated nature.
- Flexible and really comfy.
