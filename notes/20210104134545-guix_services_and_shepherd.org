* Runtime and build time
Shepherd and System services
* Shepherd and its daemons
Shepherd services and daemons.
#+begin_src shell
herd status
#+end_src

Run-time entities.
#+begin_src shell
guix system shepherd-graph | dot -Grankdir=LR -Tpdf > shepherd-graph.pdf
#+end_src
* Service is a primary guix concept
~operating-system~ is an entry point and bunch of helpers for
declaring services.

System services are building blocks for your operating system.

Confusing name clash.

#+begin_src shell
guix system extension-graph | dot -Grankdir=LR -Tpdf > extension-graph.pdf

* Simplified OS reconfiguration process
- Declare OS and services
- Extend services, instantiate missing one
- Generate system and switch to it
- Call activation script
- Adjust shepherd services according to target
- Install bootloader
* Practice
Service, service-type, service-configuration
one service-type, many instances
* Service modification

* Future work
- User configuration with services (3 options)
